# Python Scripting for Experimental Chemists

This repository contains a site for a course on Python scripting for experimental chemists. These notebooks were developed for SERMACS 2023.

The notebooks are designed to introduce students to the basics of Python programming and how it can be used to analyze experimental data. Particularly, the notebook shows data processing (peak finding, function fitting, background subtraction, integration) using packages from the scientific Python ecosystem.

In contrast to other workshops, the focus is primarly on data analysis and processing. Only a minimal amount of time is spent on the basics of Python programming (for example, loops and conditionals are not covered, since they are not needed for the subsequent data processing and analysis).

You can find the notebooks in [the accompanying repository](https://github.com/MolSSI-Education/python-experimental-chem). The notebooks are designed to be used in conjunction with the [Python Scripting for Experimental Chemists](https://education.molssi.org/python-scripting-experimental/) website.
